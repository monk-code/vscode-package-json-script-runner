# Critical Code Review

## 1. Import Ordering Violation ‚ùå

**Location:** `src/__tests__/config/biome-config.spec.ts`

```typescript
// Current (INCORRECT):
import { existsSync, readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { join } from 'node:path'
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest'

// Should be:
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { existsSync, readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { join } from 'node:path'
```

**Violation:** According to CLAUDE.md's Package Import Hierarchy, external dependencies (vitest) must come before Node.js built-ins. The current ordering violates this rule.

## 2. Project Structure Issues üö®

### Test Location Contradiction
**Issue:** Tests are located in `src/__tests__/` but CLAUDE.md explicitly states:
- "Use the `ai-workspace` or `ai` folder for temporary files"
- "Source code locations: Packages: Source code goes in the /lib folder"

The test location doesn't align with the monorepo structure described in CLAUDE.md which shows tests should be alongside their packages.

## 3. Missing Path Alias Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue:** The project uses TypeScript but there's no evidence of path alias configuration (`#/`) as required by CLAUDE.md:
```typescript
import { useBlueprintSelector } from '#/use-blueprint-selector.ts'  // Expected format
```

## 4. Lack of TDD Evidence ‚ùå

**Critical Violation:** CLAUDE.md states "TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE" and "Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test."

The current test file only verifies the existence of a configuration file, which suggests:
- Production code (biome configuration) was written before tests
- Tests were written after the fact to validate existing configuration

## 5. Git Ignore Issues üìù

### Redundant Entries
```diff
.env
.env.local
```
These could be simplified to `.env*` for better maintainability.

### Project-Specific Entries
```
test-workspace/packages/broken-package/
review.md
```
These seem like temporary or project-specific files that might belong in a global `.gitignore` rather than the project's.

## 6. Security Considerations üîí

No immediate security vulnerabilities detected in the changes.

## 7. Performance Considerations ‚ö°

No performance issues in the current changes.

## 8. Code Style & Best Practices

### Positive Aspects ‚úÖ
- Using `node:` prefix for Node.js modules (correct per CLAUDE.md)
- Test file naming follows `*.spec.ts` convention

### Missing Functional Programming Style ‚ùå
The test doesn't demonstrate the required functional programming approach:
- No use of composition
- No demonstration of pure functions
- No evidence of immutable data handling

## 9. Edge Cases & Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è

The test only checks for file existence but doesn't:
- Validate the JSON structure
- Handle malformed JSON
- Verify the configuration actually works with Biome

## 10. Documentation & Comments ‚úÖ

Good: No unnecessary comments present. Code is self-documenting through clear test descriptions.

## Summary

**Critical Issues:**
1. Import ordering violation
2. Violation of TDD principles (most severe)
3. Project structure doesn't align with monorepo guidelines
4. Missing required TypeScript path alias configuration

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix import ordering immediately
2. Restructure project to follow monorepo pattern from CLAUDE.md
3. Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts`
4. Adopt strict TDD: write failing tests first, then implementation
5. Enhance tests to validate behavior, not just file existence
