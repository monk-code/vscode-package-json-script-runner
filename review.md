# Critical Code Review

## 1. ‚ùå Import Ordering Violation

**Location:** `src/__tests__/extension/extension.spec.ts`

```typescript
// Current (INCORRECT):
import { describe, test, expect, vi } from 'vitest'

// Mock vscode before importing extension
vi.mock('vscode', () => ({...}))

// Should be:
import { describe, test, expect, vi } from 'vitest'

// Mock must be hoisted before any imports that use it
vi.mock('vscode', () => ({...}))
```

The import order is correct, but there's a subtle issue: the mock needs to be hoisted above all imports, which Vitest handles automatically.

**Location:** `src/extension/extension.ts`

```typescript
// Current (INCORRECT):
import * as vscode from 'vscode'

import { discoverPackages } from '#/package-discovery/discover-packages.js'
import { showScriptPicker } from '#/script-quick-pick/show-script-picker.js'

// Should be:
import * as vscode from 'vscode'
import { discoverPackages } from '#/package-discovery/discover-packages.js'
import { showScriptPicker } from '#/script-quick-pick/show-script-picker.js'
```

Extra blank line between external and local imports violates the import hierarchy rules.

## 2. ‚ùå TDD Violation - CRITICAL

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Direct violation of non-negotiable principle

The test file only tests that functions exist, not their behavior. This suggests:
- Production code was written first without failing tests
- Tests were added after implementation
- No evidence of Red-Green-Refactor cycle

CLAUDE.md states: "TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test."

## 3. ‚ùå Functional Programming Violations

**Location:** `src/extension/extension.ts`

```typescript
// Violation: Not using const arrow functions
export const activate = (context: vscode.ExtensionContext): void => {
  // Side effects without explicit documentation
  context.subscriptions.push(disposable)
}
```

While the code uses arrow functions correctly, it has unavoidable side effects (required by VS Code API) that aren't explicitly documented as required by CLAUDE.md.

## 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete Test Coverage

The test only verifies:
- Functions are defined
- `push` is called on subscriptions

It doesn't test:
- Command registration with correct ID
- Error handling when no workspace folders exist
- Success flow when packages are discovered
- Error flow when package discovery fails
- Script picker integration

## 5. ‚ùå Type Safety Issues

```typescript
// Weak typing in test mock
const mockContext = {
  subscriptions: {
    push: vi.fn(),
  },
} as unknown as import('vscode').ExtensionContext
```

Using `as unknown as` is a type assertion that violates the "No type assertions" rule. Should create a proper mock that satisfies the interface.

## 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

```typescript
vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
  `Error discovering packages: ${String(error)}`
)
```

Using `String(error)` loses error context. Should properly handle error types and provide meaningful messages.

## 7. ‚úÖ No Unnecessary Comments

Good adherence to "no comments" rule. Code is self-documenting.

## 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Edge Cases

- What if multiple workspace folders exist?
- What if package discovery returns empty array?
- What if user cancels the script picker?
- Race conditions if command is triggered multiple times?

## 9. üìù Package.json Issues

### Missing Required Fields
- `repository` field
- `keywords` field
- `icon` field (recommended for VS Code extensions)
- `license` field
- Proper `publisher` value (currently placeholder)

### Dependency Issues
- `fuse.js` is listed as devDependency but likely needed at runtime
- Missing `@vscode/test-electron` for proper VS Code extension testing

## 10. ‚ùå Project Structure Violation

Test files in `src/__tests__/` but CLAUDE.md specifies:
- Packages: `/lib` folder
- Apps: `/src` folder

This suggests incorrect project structure for the monorepo pattern described.

## Summary

### Critical Issues:
1. **TDD Violation** - No evidence of test-first development
2. **Insufficient Test Coverage** - Tests don't verify behavior
3. **Type Assertions** - Using `as unknown as` violates strict TypeScript rules
4. **Import Formatting** - Extra blank lines in imports

### Recommendations:
1. Rewrite using strict TDD - start with failing behavioral tests
2. Remove type assertions, create proper mocks
3. Add comprehensive error handling tests
4. Fix import formatting
5. Update package.json with required fields
6. Consider project structure alignment with monorepo guidelines
