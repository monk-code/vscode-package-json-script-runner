# Actionable Item: Documentation (`README.md` & `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

## Description

The `README.md` is currently developer-focused. For the Marketplace, it should be tailored to end-users.

## Recommendations

*   **Restructure `README.md`**:
    *   Focus on user-facing content: What the extension does, how to use it, and its features.
    *   Add visuals like GIFs or screenshots demonstrating the fuzzy search and script execution. This is one of the most effective ways to increase adoption.
    *   Move the detailed development, setup, and contribution guidelines to a separate file.
*   **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`**:
    *   Move the "Development", "Codebase Overview", and "Contributing" sections from the `README.md` into a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    *   Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the `README.md`.
