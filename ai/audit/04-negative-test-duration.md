# Actionable Item: Negative Test Duration

## Description

The test suite for `src/__tests__/script-quick-pick/search-optimization.spec.ts` reported a negative execution time. While the tests passed, this indicates a potential anomaly in the test runner's timing when using `vi.useFakeTimers()`. This is not a functional bug but could be investigated to ensure test reporting is always accurate.
