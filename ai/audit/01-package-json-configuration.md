# Actionable Item: `package.json` Configuration

## Description

The `package.json` file requires several adjustments to meet Marketplace standards and improve discoverability.

## Recommendations

*   **Publisher ID (`publisher`)**: The current value is `"bright-energy"`. **Verify that this is your registered publisher ID** on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage). If not, you must create one before publishing.
*   **Conflicting Keybinding (`keybindings`)**: The keybinding `cmd+shift+r` (macOS) and `ctrl+shift+r` (Windows/Linux) conflicts with the built-in "Restart Extension Host" command. This will cause usability issues. **A unique keybinding is required.**
    *   *Suggestion*: Consider something like `cmd+alt+r` / `ctrl+alt+r`.
*   **VS Code Engine Version (`engines.vscode`)**: The current version `^1.95.0` is very recent. To support a wider audience, consider targeting an older, stable version.
    *   *Suggestion*: Change to `^1.85.0` to balance modern features with broader compatibility.
*   **Categories (`categories`)**: The current category `"Other"` is too generic and hurts discoverability.
    *   *Suggestion*: Add more specific categories like `["Utilities", "Programming Languages", "Other"]`.
*   **Icon (`icon`)**: The extension is missing an icon. An icon is crucial for branding and making your extension stand out in the Marketplace.
    *   *Action*: Create a 128x128 PNG icon and add the `icon` property to `package.json`: `"icon": "images/icon.png"`.
