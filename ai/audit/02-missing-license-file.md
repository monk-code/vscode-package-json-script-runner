# Actionable Item: Missing `LICENSE` File

## Description

The `package.json` specifies an "MIT" license, but the `LICENSE` file itself is missing from the repository. This is a legal requirement for open-source projects.

## Recommendation

*   **Action**: Create a `LICENSE` file in the root directory with the full text of the MIT License.
