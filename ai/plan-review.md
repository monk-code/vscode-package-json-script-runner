REVIEW FINDINGS:

Here's a critical review of your plan, with suggestions for completeness, robustness, best practices, and edge cases:

1.  **Pre-commit Hook Output Clarity**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Enhance the output of the pre-commit hook. Instead of just failing, provide clear, actionable messages that guide the developer on *how* to fix the validation failures (e.g., "Linting failed. Run `pnpm lint:fix` to automatically resolve issues, or manually address errors listed above."). This significantly improves developer experience.

2.  **Lint-staged Configuration for Unstaged Changes**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Explicitly document the behavior of `lint-staged` regarding unstaged changes. Explain that `lint-staged` temporarily stashes unstaged changes, runs checks on staged files, and then unstashes. This can prevent confusion for developers who might see their unstaged changes disappear and reappear. Add this to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

3.  **Performance Thresholds for Lint-staged**:
    *   **Suggestion**: For the "Performance impact on large changesets" consideration, define concrete thresholds or strategies. For example, if a commit involves more than X files, consider running a subset of checks or providing a warning. This could be an advanced configuration for `lint-staged`.

4.  **"Quick" Mode for Development Iteration**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Formalize the "quick" mode. Add a `pnpm quick-validate` script that runs only essential, fast checks (e.g., linting, formatting) and skips time-consuming ones like full type-checking or tests. Document its use case for rapid iteration in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

5.  **Commit Message Validation - AI Attributions**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Ensure the `commitlint` configuration specifically includes a rule to prevent AI attributions or "Generated with Claude Code" messages, as per `CLAUDE.md`. This might require a custom commitlint rule or a specific pattern to disallow.

6.  **EditorConfig and Git Line Endings**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Alongside `.editorconfig`, provide guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md` on `git config core.autocrlf` and `core.eol` settings. Inconsistent line endings can cause unnecessary diffs and hook failures across different operating systems.

7.  **Pre-push Hook (Optional Future Enhancement)**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Consider adding a `pre-push` hook for more extensive, potentially slower, validation that might be too disruptive for `pre-commit`. This could include running all tests, a full build, or security scans before code is pushed to the remote repository. This should be an optional, later phase.

8.  **Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Expand the `CONTRIBUTING.md` troubleshooting section. Include common scenarios like "My hook failed, but I don't see any errors," "How do I bypass a hook temporarily?", and "My editor is reformatting files differently than Biome."

9.  **Platform-Specific Setup Instructions**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Ensure `CONTRIBUTING.md` provides explicit, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment and git hooks on Windows, macOS, and Linux, addressing potential differences in file permissions or shell environments.
