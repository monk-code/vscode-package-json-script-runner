# Cross-Platform Compatibility Report

## Overview
This report details the findings from a deep dive into the codebase to identify potential cross-platform compatibility issues, specifically concerning Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. The primary focus was on file system operations and shell command generation.

## Findings

### 1. Hardcoded Path Separator in `src/package-discovery/discover-packages.ts`
**Issue:** The file `src/package-discovery/discover-packages.ts` contains a hardcoded forward slash (`/`) when manipulating file paths.
```typescript
const packageDir = filePath.replace('/package.json', '')
```
This line assumes a Unix-like path separator. On Windows, paths use backslashes (`\`), which will cause this `replace` operation to fail or produce incorrect paths.

**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect package directory resolution on Windows, potentially preventing the extension from discovering `package.json` files and their associated scripts.

**Recommendation:**
The `node:path` module should be used to handle path manipulation in a platform-agnostic way. Specifically, `path.dirname()` should be used to get the directory name from a file path, and `path.join()` should be used to construct paths with the correct platform-specific separator.

The problematic line `const packageDir = filePath.replace('/package.json', '')` should be replaced with `const packageDir = dirname(filePath)`.

Additionally, any future path constructions involving `package.json` should use `path.join(directory, 'package.json')` instead of concatenating strings with hardcoded slashes.

### 2. Shell Command Generation (`src/script-execution/generate-command.ts`)
**Observation:** The `generate-command.ts` file constructs shell commands for different package managers (pnpm, yarn, npm).
```typescript
// Examples from generate-command.ts
return `pnpm --filter ${packageIdentifier} ${scriptName}`
return `yarn workspace ${packageIdentifier} ${scriptName}`
return `npm run ${scriptName} --workspace=${packageIdentifier}`
```
These commands are generally cross-platform compatible as they rely on the respective package managers to handle underlying shell differences.

**Recommendation:** Continue to rely on the package managers for command execution, as they are designed to abstract away OS-specific shell nuances. No immediate changes are required here based on this review.

### 3. Terminal Management (`src/script-execution/terminal-manager.ts`)
**Observation:** The `terminal-manager.ts` file uses the VS Code API `vscode.window.createTerminal` and `terminal.sendText`.
```typescript
const terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal({
  name: terminalName,
  cwd: workingDirectory,
})
terminal.sendText(command)
```
The VS Code API is designed to be cross-platform, abstracting away the differences in terminal implementations across operating systems. The `cwd` (current working directory) option also handles paths correctly across platforms when provided with an absolute path.

**Recommendation:** No immediate changes are required here. The VS Code API handles cross-platform compatibility for terminal interactions.

### 4. Package Manager Detection (`src/package-manager/detect-package-manager.ts`)
**Observation:** This file uses `node:fs` and `node:path` to check for the existence of lock files (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`) and reads `package.json`.
```typescript
import { promises as fs } from 'node:fs'
import { join } from 'node:path'
// ...
const lockFilePath = join(workspacePath, file)
await fs.access(lockFilePath)
```
The `node:fs` and `node:path` modules are inherently cross-platform, handling file system interactions and path joining correctly regardless of the operating system.

**Recommendation:** No immediate changes are required here. The current implementation correctly uses Node.js built-in modules for cross-platform file system operations.

## Conclusion

The most significant cross-platform compatibility issue identified is the hardcoded path separator in `src/package-discovery/discover-packages.ts`. Addressing this by using `path.dirname()` will ensure correct package discovery on all supported operating systems. Other areas of the codebase appear to leverage cross-platform APIs and modules effectively.
