# Research Report: Visually Appealing Validation Script

## Objective
To design a Node.js script that replaces the existing `validate` command in `package.json`. The new script should provide concise, visually appealing feedback (loaded, failed, complete states) for each validation step, logging verbose output only when errors occur.

## Key Findings

### 1. Executing Shell Commands (`child_process`)
The `child_process` module in Node.js is essential for running external commands.
- **`spawn`**: This is the most suitable method for our use case. It's ideal for long-running processes and streams `stdout` and `stderr` in real-time. This allows us to capture output for error logging without buffering large amounts of data, and to control the display of progress. Arguments to the command should be passed as an array of strings. To execute commands that require a shell (e.g., commands with pipes or glob patterns), the `shell: true` option should be used.
- `exec` and `execSync` are less suitable due to their buffering behavior or synchronous nature, respectively.

### 2. Visual Feedback (Spinners & Status Messages)
Libraries like `ora` and `nanospinner` are excellent for creating interactive CLI experiences.
- **`ora`**: This library is highly recommended for its rich features, customization options (spinner type, color, text), and ability to integrate with Promises. It allows dynamic updates to the spinner's text, which is perfect for showing "loading...", "complete", and "failed" states.
- `nanospinner` is a lightweight alternative, but `ora`'s feature set makes it more robust for this task.

### 3. Suppressing Verbose Output & Logging Errors Only
To achieve a clean output with errors only, we can leverage `child_process` stream handling and shell redirection.
- When spawning a child process, we can pipe its `stdout` to `/dev/null` (on Unix-like systems) or `NUL` (on Windows) to suppress its regular output.
- We will capture the `stderr` stream of the child process. If a command fails (non-zero exit code), the captured `stderr` content can then be displayed.
- `console.log()` writes to `stdout`, and `console.error()` writes to `stderr`. By redirecting `stdout` of the child process, only `stderr` will be visible by default, which aligns with the requirement to only log errors.

### 4. Handling Exit Codes
Proper handling of exit codes is crucial for script reliability.
- A child process's `exit` event provides the `code` (exit code) and `signal` (if terminated by a signal).
- An exit code of `0` indicates success; any non-zero code indicates failure.
- The parent Node.js script should listen for the `exit` event and propagate the child process's exit code. If any validation step fails, the main validation script should also exit with a non-zero code.
- When writing the Node.js script itself, `process.exitCode = <code_value>` is preferred over `process.exit(<code_value>)`. Setting `process.exitCode` allows the Node.js event loop to complete any pending asynchronous operations before exiting gracefully, whereas `process.exit()` terminates immediately, potentially leading to lost output or incomplete operations.

### 5. CLI Output Formatting
- **`chalk`**: This library is widely used for adding colors and styles to terminal text. It will be invaluable for making the "complete" and "failed" messages visually distinct and appealing (e.g., green for success, red for failure).

## Proposed Script Structure

The validation script (`scripts/validate.mjs`) will be an asynchronous Node.js module.

1.  **Dependencies**: `ora` for spinners, `chalk` for coloring output.
2.  **Validation Steps**: An array of objects, each defining a step with a descriptive name and the command to execute.
3.  **Execution Loop**: Iterate through each validation step.
    *   For each step, initialize an `ora` spinner with a "loading..." message.
    *   Spawn the command using `child_process.spawn`.
    *   Capture `stderr` from the spawned process.
    *   On process `exit`:
        *   If the exit code is `0`, update the spinner to "complete" with a success message (e.g., green checkmark).
        *   If the exit code is non-zero, update the spinner to "failed" with a failure message (e.g., red cross) and display the captured `stderr`. Set `process.exitCode` to indicate overall failure.
    *   Handle `error` events from `spawn` (e.g., command not found).
4.  **Overall Exit Code**: The script will exit with `0` if all steps pass, or a non-zero code if any step fails.

This approach will provide a clean, user-friendly validation experience while retaining the ability to debug issues by showing relevant error output.
