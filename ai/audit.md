# VS Code Extension Audit Report: Package.json Script Runner

## 1. Overall Summary

This audit provides a comprehensive review of the `vscode-package-json-script-runner` extension to identify issues and offer recommendations for a successful release on the VS Code Marketplace.

The extension is well-structured, has a comprehensive test suite, and follows modern development practices. All validation checks (linting, formatting, type checking, and tests) pass successfully, indicating a high level of code quality.

The primary recommendations focus on improving the extension's Marketplace presence, ensuring compliance with publishing requirements, and enhancing user-facing documentation.

## 2. High-Priority Recommendations (Must-Fix Before Release)

These items are critical for a successful and compliant Marketplace launch.

### 2.1. `package.json` Configuration

The `package.json` file requires several adjustments to meet Marketplace standards and improve discoverability.

*   **Publisher ID (`publisher`)**: The current value is `"bright-energy"`. **Verify that this is your registered publisher ID** on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage). If not, you must create one before publishing.
*   **Conflicting Keybinding (`keybindings`)**: The keybinding `cmd+shift+r` (macOS) and `ctrl+shift+r` (Windows/Linux) conflicts with the built-in "Restart Extension Host" command. This will cause usability issues. **A unique keybinding is required.**
    *   *Suggestion*: Consider something like `cmd+alt+r` / `ctrl+alt+r`.
*   **VS Code Engine Version (`engines.vscode`)**: The current version `^1.95.0` is very recent. To support a wider audience, consider targeting an older, stable version.
    *   *Suggestion*: Change to `^1.85.0` to balance modern features with broader compatibility.
*   **Categories (`categories`)**: The current category `"Other"` is too generic and hurts discoverability.
    *   *Suggestion*: Add more specific categories like `["Utilities", "Programming Languages", "Other"]`.
*   **Icon (`icon`)**: The extension is missing an icon. An icon is crucial for branding and making your extension stand out in the Marketplace.
    *   *Action*: Create a 128x128 PNG icon and add the `icon` property to `package.json`: `"icon": "images/icon.png"`.

### 2.2. Missing `LICENSE` File

The `package.json` specifies an "MIT" license, but the `LICENSE` file itself is missing from the repository. This is a legal requirement for open-source projects.

*   **Action**: Create a `LICENSE` file in the root directory with the full text of the MIT License.

## 3. Medium-Priority Recommendations (Important for Quality)

These items will significantly improve the user and contributor experience.

### 3.1. Documentation (`README.md` & `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

The `README.md` is currently developer-focused. For the Marketplace, it should be tailored to end-users.

*   **Restructure `README.md`**:
    *   Focus on user-facing content: What the extension does, how to use it, and its features.
    *   Add visuals like GIFs or screenshots demonstrating the fuzzy search and script execution. This is one of the most effective ways to increase adoption.
    *   Move the detailed development, setup, and contribution guidelines to a separate file.
*   **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`**:
    *   Move the "Development", "Codebase Overview", and "Contributing" sections from the `README.md` into a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    *   Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the `README.md`.

## 4. Low-Priority Recommendations (Minor Issues)

*   **Negative Test Duration**: The test suite for `src/__tests__/script-quick-pick/search-optimization.spec.ts` reported a negative execution time. While the tests passed, this indicates a potential anomaly in the test runner's timing when using `vi.useFakeTimers()`. This is not a functional bug but could be investigated to ensure test reporting is always accurate.

## 5. VS Code Marketplace Release Best Practices

Here is a checklist to guide your release process:

### 5.1. Preparation

- [ ] **Create a Publisher Account**: If you don't have one, create a publisher account on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).
- [ ] **Install `vsce`**: Install the official CLI tool for publishing extensions: `pnpm install -g @vscode/vsce`.
- [ ] **Finalize `package.json`**: Implement the high-priority recommendations above. Ensure `name`, `publisher`, `version`, and `repository` are correct.
- [ ] **Create a `.vscodeignore` file**: Similar to `.gitignore`, this file prevents unnecessary files from being included in your extension package, reducing its size. At a minimum, it should include:
    ```
    .vscode/**
    .github/**
    node_modules/**
    src/**
    test/**
    .editorconfig
    .gitignore
    *.md
    !README.md
    !LICENSE
    *.ts
    *.mts
    *.mjs
    *.json
    !package.json
    pnpm-lock.yaml
    ```
    *(Note: `vsce` has some default ignores, but being explicit is good practice)*.

### 5.2. Packaging & Publishing

1.  **Package the Extension**: Run `vsce package` to create a `.vsix` file. This is the file that gets installed in VS Code. You can use this for final local testing by installing it from the command line (`code --install-extension <file>.vsix`).
2.  **Login to your Publisher**: Run `vsce login <publisher-name>`. You will need a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Azure DevOps organization.
3.  **Publish**: Run `vsce publish`. If you only want to package and not publish, use `vsce package`.

### 5.3. Post-Release

*   **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`) to signal the nature of your updates. Use `vsce publish minor` or `vsce publish major` to increment the version automatically.
*   **Engage with Users**: Monitor your GitHub issues and Marketplace page for feedback and bug reports.
*   **Add a `CHANGELOG.md`**: For future releases, maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes between versions.

By addressing these points, you can ensure a high-quality, successful launch for your extension.
